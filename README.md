# kauri-fullstack-dapp-tutorial-series

This repository holds the example and reference code for the [Full stack dApp tutorial series](https://kauri.io/collection/5b8e401ee727370001c942e3/full-stack-dapp-tutorial-series) on Kauri

In this series, we'll build a simple dApp (decentralised application)
 
We'll introduce all the different pieces of the tech stack and tools you can use to build a dApp
 
The dApp will simply allow any user to issue a bounty in ETH

* Any user with an Ethereum account can Issue a bounty in ETH with the requirements
* Any user can submit a fulfilment of the bounty with evidence
* The bounty issuer can accept a fulfilment which would result in the fulfiller being paid out
